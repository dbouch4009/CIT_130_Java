README
Because my last iteration of AnyCar Manufacturing was totally unhinged from an organizational perspective, and was tightly coupled to text parsing for the config, I made the choice to restart the project from scratch for the XML lab.
Although it does not have all of the same functionality as the previous lab, it is verified to work with ThisAuto Sedans.
I believe that, through this, it demonstrates a good understanding of XML DOM usage, even if some of the functionality present in previous labs is not here.
Thank You,
Damian
