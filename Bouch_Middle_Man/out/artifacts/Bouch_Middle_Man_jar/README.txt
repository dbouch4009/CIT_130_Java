Mr Acklin,

To launch this program, navigate to this directory in your command line and key in:
java -jar Bouch_Middle_Man.jar

This will launch the other two .jar files, which are the Writer and Reader, respectively. They will all three be in separate windows.

Key your text into the top box of the Writer's GUI, and press enter to begin the chain of encryption and decrytion.

I had trouble visualizing how this project would work, so I assigned a GUI to each socket after following some online resources that explained how to set up a box.

I spent the better part of three whole days trying to get the encrypt/decrypt to work. When I finally threw in the towel earlier tonight and put the .jar files in the same directory, the decrytion magically began to work.

I'm not offering explanations, but I just wanted to let you know how much trouble it was!
